# Urban-Street-Networks-Clustering-Cities-by-Spatial-Order
This project explores clustering techniques to analyze urban street network patterns using data from 100 global cities. By applying K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, we uncover similarities in street orientation, configuration, and entropy, providing insights into urban spatial structures.
